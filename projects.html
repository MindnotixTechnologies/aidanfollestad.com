potential through training, collaboration, and self-discovery. It's quickly being developed to other professional
and non-professional fields. It's available on both <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skillfitness.skillfitness'>Android</a> and
<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skillfitness/id787386054'>iOS</a>, your company needs to be signed up

Tom came to me with the need for a new dashboard to be used in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wellingtomworks.gaufrer">Gaufrer</a>. 
Polar is designed to be different, beautiful, and professional. It also happens to be very easily configurable. Check out the 
<a href="https://github.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard">GitHub repo</a> and <a href="http://afollestad.github.io/polar-dashboard/">Getting Started guide</a>.

Rather than receiving emails, designers receive organized icon requests from an online dashboard which shows how many times
an app's icon has been requested, along with whether or not you've completed the request. It can even generate appfilters
for you. You can register an account on <a href="https://polar.aidanfollestad.com">polar.aidanfollestad.com</a>. There's also
a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.polarbackendadmin">mobile client for Android devices</a>.

will "knock" on the door of your web server on a chosen interval (<em>it actually makes a GET request</em>) to see if it responds and returns a
successful response code. If it does not, you are notified. Nock Nock is on <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.nocknock'>Google Play</a>,
it's also <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/nock-nock'>open source</a>.

example of what it can do. It's currently in beta, you can <a href='https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.afollestad.photoaffix'>opt-in to Google Play Beta Testing</a>,

order to improve the availability of good file managers on Android that are
up to date with Google's Material design guidelines. Currently this project is on hold
since I do not have enough time to keep up with it.

another Twitter app called <em>Peeper</em> as an experiment, but <a target="_blank"
                                                                href="https://twitter.com/redbullcat">Philip
Oakley</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gmph">Graham MacPhee</a> contacted me over
email with design mockups and ideas for a new Twitter application for Android.
I became their coder and we worked on Boid for quite some time while it spread
like a virus and got almost 50,000 downloads. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kennydude">Joe
Simpson</a>
joined our team as another coder to help me out. We eventually had to take the
project down from Google Play because Twitter changed their API policies
and Boid became too much to maintain and update. You can find information
about this project by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Boid+for+Android">searching
Google</a>.

It was published for a while but I decided I succeeded with my experiment and unpublished it.
</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/ui-showcase/master/overhear.png" class="app-image"><hr><h4>Material Dialogs</h4><p class="flow-text">This library is a solution I had to using Material design themed dialogs across all versions of Android,
not just Lollipop. It also makes building and theming dialogs easier. The project is <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs'>
available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.materialdialogssample'>sample on Google Play</a>.

available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.digitussample'>sample on Google Play</a>.
</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/digitus/master/digitusshowcase.png" class="app-image"><hr><h4>Material Camera</h4><p class="flow-text">Video recording is one of the hardest things to do for Android developers. Compatibility is very inconsistent
among many different devices (due to different Android versions, how manufacturers mount camera sensors, etc.).
This library is a result of research and testing done during development of SkillFitness. The project is
<a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-camera'>available on GitHub</a>, along with a tutorial and Gradle
dependency.
</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/material-camera/master/art/showcase.png" class="app-image-small"><hr><h4>Bridge</h4><p class="flow-text">Bridge is a simple but powerful networking library for Android. It features a Fluent chainable API,

be <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/bridge'>found on GitHub</a>.
</p><hr><h4>Inquiry</h4><p class="flow-text">Inquiry is a simple library for Android that simplifies construction and use of SQLite databases on Android.
It can be <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/inquiry'>found on GitHub</a>.
</p><hr><h4>DragSelectRecyclerView</h4><p class="flow-text">Google Photos made multi-selection by dragging your finger popular. I needed a solution to do this in Photo Affix,

</p><hr><h4>Material CAB</h4><p class="flow-text">This library is a solution to an issue I had in Cabinet. The stock contextual action bar (selection mode) on
Android is limited in placement and dynamic customization (for Cabinet's theme engine). This library allows the
CAB to be dynamically themed and placed wherever you like. It can be <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-cab'>found on GitHub</a>.
