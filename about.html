</p><hr><h4>Hometown</h4><p class="flow-text">My name is Aidan Michael Follestad. I was born on July 28<sup>th</sup>, 1995 in St. Paul, Minnesota to my mom
Natalie Michael (maiden name <em>Swenson</em>), and my dad Jeffrey Follestad. I grew up living in St. Paul and
Minneapolis&#8212; the great Twin Cities. As I was growing up, my parents let me try many different things and
provided me with the resources to try them; the major things that came out were playing the drums, snowboarding,
and computer programming (my <a href="skills">skills</a> and <a href="work">work experience</a> pages
contain specifics about what I know).
</p><hr><h4>School</h4><p class="flow-text">I went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.childrenshousemontessori-stpaul.com/">Children's House</a>
Montessori on Randolph in St. Paul for pre-school. I later attended <a target="_blank"
                                                                   href="http://armatage.mpls.k12.mn.us">Armatage</a>
in Minneapolis for kindergarten. From 1<sup>st</sup> grade to 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I attended <a
    target="_blank" href="http://lmap.spps.org">Linwood A+ Elementary School</a> in St. Paul before the school
merged with Monroe. For 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>
grade, I attended <a target="_blank" href="http://ramsey.spps.org">Ramsey Junior High</a>.
I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="http://central.spps.org">Central Senior High School</a> with the Class of 2014;
I attended the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uwstout.edu">University of Wisconsin Stout</a> for a year,
but I'm currently taking a break as it's not required for my work at the moment.
</p><hr><h4>Career Path</h4><p class="flow-text">I'm currently employed full time at Target HQ as an Android Engineer. Before that, I was employed by SkillFitness&reg;
in downtown Minneapolis, which started out as independent contracting. Before that, I was employed as the <em>lead
Android and iOS developer</em> for a small startup company in Bloomington, MN called Ricco Solutions. I've
been a programmer for 9+ years. In the future, I'd like to start my own
app development company, or work for Google.

an active Android developer in the community by <a target="_blank"

</p><hr><h4>Favorite Quotes</h4><p class="flow-text"><em>&#8220;You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful,
to make this life a wonderful adventure.&#8221;</em> <b><i><a href='/great-dictator'>More...</a></i></b>
</p><p class="flow-text"><em>&#8220;Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma,
which is living the result of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other opinions
drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition,
they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.&#8221;</em> &#8212; <span id="highlight">Steve Jobs</span></p><p class="flow-text"><em>&#8220;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a
    heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of
the people.&#8221;</em> &#8212; <span id="highlight">Karl Marx</span></p></div></main><script src="/js/init.js"></script><script src="/js/analytics.js"></script></body></html>
